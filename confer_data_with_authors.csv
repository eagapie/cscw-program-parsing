We discuss (1) the work to make the co-op work, that is, the special effort involved in managing an enterprise in a democratic and inclusive way, (2) the multiple purposes that cooperatives can serve for their members, well beyond financial benefit, and (3) ICT usage within cooperatives as a site of tension and dialogue.

However, newsrooms are often overwhelmed by the vast number of diverse comments, for which a manual analysis is barely feasible. Identifying meta-comments that address or mention newsrooms, individual journalists, or moderators and that may call for reactions is particularly critical. In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. We compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. We develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large German online newsroom SPIEGEL Online and the ""One Million Posts"" corpus of DER STANDARD, an Austrian newspaper. Both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging F0.5 values between 76% and 91%.

Though this medium creates unique opportunities for interactive learning, it also brings about the challenge of creating a useful archive for post-hoc learning. This paper presents the results of interviews with knowledge sharing streamers, their moderators, and viewers to understand current experiences and needs for sharing and learning knowledge through live streaming. Based on those findings, we built StreamWiki, a tool which leverages the availability of live stream viewers to produce useful archives of the interactive learning experience. On StreamWiki, moderators initiate high-level tasks that viewers complete by conducting microtasks, such as writing summaries, sending comments, and voting for informative comments. As a result, a summary document is built in real time. Through the tests of our prototype with streamers and viewers, we found that StreamWiki could help viewers understand the content and the context of the stream, during the stream and also later, for post-hoc learning.",,Live streaming; knowledge sharing; knowledge building; collaborative documentation; learning,H.5.m,,,,,,,,FormatComplete,,Zhicong,,Lu,,luzhc@cs.toronto.edu,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,Seongkook,,Heo,,seongkook@dgp.toronto.edu,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,Daniel,J,Wigdor,,daniel@dgp.toronto.edu,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zhicong Lu: University of Toronto; Seongkook Heo: University of Toronto; Daniel J Wigdor: University of Toronto,seongkook@dgp.toronto.edu; daniel@dgp.toronto.edu,1007

Unfortunately, many real-world systems have been unsuccessful in continually motivating large numbers of citizens to participate voluntarily, despite various approaches such as gamification and persuasion techniques. In this paper, we examine the influence of personalized messages designed to support motivation as asserted by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We designed a crowd-civic platform for collecting community issues with personalized motivation-supportive messages and conducted two studies: a pair-comparison experiment with 150 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and a live deployment study with 120 university members. Results of the pair-comparison study indicate applicability of SDT's perspective in crowd-civic systems. While applying it in the live system surfaced several challenges, including recruiting participants without interfering with general motivations, the collected data exhibited similar promising trends.

In the game, rich statistics about each individual player’s gaming history and performance are publicly available, analyzed and displayed on numerous third-party sites. We describe how players were entangled with numbers. They derived knowledge from numbers but struggled with proper ways of interpretation. They utilized numbers to quantify teammates and opponents, but in-game tensions and conflicts easily ensued.

Such analysis relies on collating interactions by a unique identifier such as a user ID. However, if users can contribute without being logged-in (i.e., anonymously) analysis of interaction data omit part of a user's experience. Problematically, anonymous traces are unlikely to be randomly distributed, so their omission can change statistical conclusions, with implications for both research and practice. To understand the impacts on conclusions of leaving out anonymous traces, we conducted an analysis of system logs from two online citizen science projects. Attributing anonymous traces with user IDs, we found that (1) many users contribute anonymously, though with varied patterns; and (2) attributing anonymous traces diminishes empirical evidence used to support theory and change the results of system algorithms. These results suggest anonymous traces have implications for research on user behaviors and the practices associated with using such data to tailor user experiences in online communities.",,citizen science; user behavior; online communities; anonymity; Zooniverse,H.5.m,National Science Foundation,15-47880,,,,,,FormatComplete,,Corey,Brian,Jackson,,cjacks04@syr.edu,Syracuse University,Syracuse,New York,United States,,,,,,Kevin,,Crowston,,crowston@syr.edu,Syracuse University,Syracuse,New York,United States,,,,,,Carsten,,Østerlund,,costerlu@syr.edu,Syracuse University,Syracuse,New York,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Corey Brian Jackson: Syracuse University; Kevin Crowston: Syracuse University; Carsten Østerlund: Syracuse University,crowston@syr.edu; costerlu@syr.edu,1047

Evacuation from potentially affected areas stands out among the most critical factors that can reduce mortality and vulnerability to crisis. We know surprisingly little about the factors that drive this important and often life-saving behavior, though recent work has suggested that social capital may play a critical and previously underestimated role in disaster preparedness. Moving beyond retrospective self-reporting and vehicle count estimates, we use social media data to examine connections between levels of social capital and evacuation behavior. This work is the first of its kind, examining these phenomena across three major disasters in the United States---Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria---using aggregated, de-identified data from over 1.5 million Facebook users. Our analysis confirms that, holding confounding factors constant, several aspects of social capital are correlated with whether or not an individual evacuates. Higher levels of bridging and linking social ties correlate strongly with evacuation.

The study involved 10 dyads of co-workers in two groups (a distributed vs. a co-located group) based on their proximity at work. The effectiveness of the proposed PCFT was examined by comparing fitness data over a period of three weeks: the baseline week, the PCFT intervention week, and the post-intervention week. The proximity effects on PCFT were investigated by comparing the fitness data, goal commitment, and interview results between the two groups. The quantitative results showed that the physical activity of participants in the co-located group improved significantly after the PCFT intervention. The qualitative results suggested that PCFT may improve the awareness of being physically active, stimulate exchange of knowledge to support active lifestyles and facilitate including fitness breaks in the daily work routine.

Bound by social norms that restrict their movements and tether them to spotty mobile data, women’s Internet usage is limited in comparison to men, whose relatively unconstrained mobility permits them access and use of the free WiFi in the community. Additionally, interviews with a commercial WiFi provider reveals naive assumptions about women’s Internet habits and gendered mobilities constraining access.

We found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""Porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home.

Using a content analysis of papers from both fields, I show that AGR consistently operationalises gender in a trans-exclusive way, and consequently carries disproportionate risk for trans people subject to it. In addition, I use the dearth of discussion of this in HCI papers that apply AGR to discuss how HCI operationalises gender, and the implications that this has for the field's research.

We studied people's reasons for and against adopting smart speakers, their privacy perceptions and concerns, and their privacy-seeking behaviors around smart speakers. We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside.

These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their “personal social media ecosystems” to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.

We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). We found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict.

We describe the real, perceived, and unknown risks they face as they navigate online transactions with limited technical skills, as well as the strategies and heuristics they employ to minimize these risks. The findings highlight a complex relationship between participants’ negative experiences and their general mistrust of sharing data through online channels.

The impact of Airbnb listings on local neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and in particular urban tourism. In this paper, we argue that urban tourism space can no longer be understood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist approach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a research direction in the CSCW community that is concerned with the role of digital technologies in the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of representations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study, we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzkölln and City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing descriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned places differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination management organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment. In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many places also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzkölln, in contrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb, power relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs towards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.",,airbnb; new urban tourism; digital tourism space; collaborative space production; social constructionism; data mining; mixed methods study,H.1.2,,,,,,,,FormatComplete,,Natalie,,Stors,,stors@uni-trier.de,University of Trier,Trier,,Germany,,,,,,Sebastian,,Baltes,,research@sbaltes.com,University of Trier,Trier,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Natalie Stors: University of Trier; Sebastian Baltes: University of Trier,stors@uni-trier.de,1278

To test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (Knowledge Worker’s Dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams.

To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited.

Specifically, it offers three inter-related analytical sensibilities from feminist and critical race studies—“noticing differently,” “walking alongside” and “parasitic resistance”— to support political and activist approaches in CSCW and related fields.",,Intervention; alternative; China; Taiwan; political economy; capitalism; design; maker; feminist; race;,"• Human-centered computing~HCI theory, concepts and models   • Human-centered computing~Ethnographic studies   • Human-centered computing~Empirical studies in HCI",National Science Foundation,1617898,National Science Foundation,1513596,National Science Foundation,1516204,,FormatComplete,,Silvia,,Lindtner,,lindtner@umich.edu,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,Shaowen,,Bardzell,,selu@indiana.edu,"Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering",Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,Jeffrey,,Bardzell,,jbardzel@indiana.edu,Indiana University,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Silvia Lindtner: University of Michigan; Shaowen Bardzell: Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering; Jeffrey Bardzell: Indiana University",selu@indiana.edu; jbardzel@indiana.edu,1302

We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.

The combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing.

In this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work.

We conducted an observational lab study to examine how preschoolers (age 3-5) and parents (N=74) from three different regions of the world (communities in China, Taiwan, and the United States) engage with two types of tablet games: an instructional game with goals and an exploratory, open-ended game. We found systematic differences among groups and between games. For example, parents from China and Taiwan frequently picked up their child’s hand and used it as a tool to engage with the screen, a practice parents in our U.S. sample did not employ. Dyads from all three samples exhibited more warmth when playing an instructional game than an exploratory one. Our results suggest that characteristics of the populations we sampled interact with design features—that is, the same design prompted opposing behaviors in different groups. We conclude that it may be useful to examine goal-free and goal-oriented JME as separate constructs, that design choices influence the roles parents adopt during JME, and that the range of behaviors we observed complicate the prevailing research narrative of what positive and productive JME looks like.

This paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their Facebook account. An abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. The analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to Facebook or not. The discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use.

Results show that case resolvability depends on various factors, including the level and reasons for the initial disagreement, as well as the amount and quality of deliberation activities.

We found that ride-hailing services positively affects participants' notions of independence, and we tease out how independence for our participants is not just about 'doing things alone, without help' but is also situated, social and relative.

We here report results from a crowdsourcing study (N=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and MOOC learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in MOOCs. This serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. Overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to MOOC learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate.

Hence, in order to enable studies of online social environmental measures like attitudes on social media and their possible relationship to health outcomes, first there is a need for a method to define the collective, underlying degree of social media attitudes by region. To address this, we create the Socio-spatial-Self organizing map, ""SS-SOM"" pipeline to best identify regions by their latent social attitude from Twitter posts. SS-SOMs use neural embedding for text-classification, and augment traditional SOMs to generate a controlled number of non-overlapping, topologically-constrained and topically-similar clusters.

Through a study of 16 dyads, we found that ReactionBot was able to help communicate participants’ affect, reducing the need for participants to self-react with emoji during conversations. However, contrary to our hypothesis, ReactionBot reduced social presence (behavioral interdependence) between dyads. Post study interviews suggest that the emotion feedback through ReactionBot indeed provided valuable nonverbal cues: offered more genuine feedback, and participants were more aware of their own emotions. However, this can come at the cost of increasing anxiety from concerns about negative emotion leakage. Further, the more active role of the system in facilitating the conversation can also result in unwanted distractions and may have attributed to the reduced sense of behavioral interdependence.

When hearing people collaborate around computers, they rely on the ability to simultaneously see and hear as they start a shared document, talk to each other while editing, and gesture towards the screen. This interaction norm breaks down for teams of people with different sensory abilities, such as Deaf and hearing collaborators, who rely on visual communication. Through interviews and observations, we analyze how Deaf-hearing teams collaborate on a variety of naturalistic tasks. Our findings reveal that Deaf-hearing teams create accessibility through their moment-to-moment co-located interaction and emerging team practices over time. We conclude with a discussion of how studying co-located Deaf-hearing interaction extends our understanding of accessibility in mixed-ability teams and provides new insights for groupware systems.

In doing so this paper makes three contributions. First, it illustrates how to combine a spatial focus on people's movement and interaction through the physical environment with an analysis of social media use in order to gain a deeper understanding of practices such as personal curation. Second, it shows in greater detail how visitors to museums and cultural heritage sites use and link digital information with physical information to shape others' understandings of cultural heritage.

Often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ``What is your thinking style?''). Research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. Could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? To investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. We found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a `supporting science' frame to a `comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies.

Combining results 2 and 3, when segmenting analysts based on output rate and 'local' social influence, the viewing of queries authored by analysts with high output but low local influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity; whereas when segmenting based on output rate and 'global' social influence, the viewing of queries authored analysts with high output and high global influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity.

We conducted a deep qualitative analysis of how six pairs of children, ages 6 to 10, interacted with the application. Our analysis revealed that the collaboration styles differed for each pair, both in regards to the interaction with the task and with each other. Several pairs exhibited negative physical and verbal collaborative behaviors, such as nudging each other out of the way. Based on our analysis, we suggest that it is important for a collaborative task to offer equal opportunities for interaction, but it may not be necessary to strive for complete equity of collaboration. We examine the applicability of prior design guidelines and suggest open questions for future research to inform the design of tabletop applications to support collaboration for children.

We designed MyPath to overcome these information access challenges.

Through a seven-month deployment study with breast cancer patients, we found that use of the application encouraged proactive health management behaviors, and identified factors that motivated technology adoption and abandonment. We discuss the implications of these results for facilitating use of mHealth tools by a rural patient population and the importance of scaling support to a large range of information needs.

We find that there is a mismatch between the designer’s conception of how care should be delivered and the ways that participants were interested in using the system. This mismatch exists in four areas: participants’ interest in getting to know the human teleoperators and rejecting the virtual avatar, interrogating the interface to figure out the inner workings of the platform, pushing for a more symmetrical relationship, and negotiating the relation work that they were willing to perform in the “sacred space” of their homes. We draw on the concept of heteromation to understand the political dimensions of telehealth aging in place technologies.

Typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale.

To address this gap, I use experience sampling with diverse samples of Facebook (N = 362) and Twitter (N = 416) users, assessing the browsing experience across a wide range of emotions.

To this end, we collected geo-referenced picture tags from Flickr and matched those tags with the words in a newly created ambiance dictionary. In so doing, we made four main contributions: i) map the ambiance of London neighborhoods; ii) ascertain that such a mapping meets residents' expectations, which are derived from a survey we conducted; iii) show that computer vision techniques upon  geo-referenced pictures are of  predictive power for neighborhood ambiance; and iv) explain each prediction of a neighborhood's ambiance by identifying the picture that best reflects the meaning of that ambiance (e.g., artsy) in that neighborhood (e.g., South Kensington---the richest and most traditional neighborhood---and  Shoreditch---among the most progressive and hipster neighborhoods in the city---are both `artsy' but in very different ways).

Does NPOV tagging help articles to converge to the desired style? Do NPOV corrections encourage editors to adopt this style? We study these questions using a corpus of NPOV-tagged articles and a set of lexicons associated with biased language. An interrupted time series analysis shows that after an article is tagged for NPOV, there is a significant decrease in biased language in the article, as measured by several lexicons. However, for individual editors, NPOV corrections and talk page discussions yield no significant change in the usage of words in most of these lexicons, including Wikipedia's own list of ``words to watch.''

This paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural Sri Lanka. Through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. Our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. Using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. We also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. We contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and technology designers.

First, code-related explanations are dichotomous, containing fragments of code and associated natural language descriptions that are not necessarily sequential. Second, explanations of code often involve multiple stages of modifying code in steps, but these intermediate steps are difficult to capture. This paper introduces chat.codes, a new tool for creating guided explanations about code, meant to be consumed asynchronously. chat.codes introduces three features that make it easier to communicate about code. First, it introduces deictic code references, which allow users to reference specific regions of code in parts of their explanations. Second, it tracks and summarizes code edits in-line with messages, allowing users to create explanations in stages. Third, it tracks every version of code, enabling future users to back-track to a previous version of code to reconstruct the context for code references and explanations.

One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such  as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested.

To offer NNSs more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects between two pre-defined spoken languages, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or NNS’s native language).

In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that  organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by  rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals.

Despite these challenges, practitioners in global development do appear to value and engage with research as they strive for positive impact across their target communities. Our analysis suggests that the domain of human-computer interaction for development (HCI4D) might benefit from engaging in \textit{``informed practice''} through alignment with design-based implementation research (DBIR), which unites researchers and practitioners in their shared commitment to both research and practice, even if research and practice respectively remain their primary commitments. Our work provides CSCW and HCI4D researchers with new ways to conceptualize and navigate the above research-practice divide.

Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.",,Hackathon; Project Sustainability; Innovation; Learning,H.5.3.

Toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in South Korea. We found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. In particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. In real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. Based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction.",,Sticker; Emoji; Message Interpretation; Instant Messaging,H.4.3; H.5.m,IITP grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT),R7124-16-0004,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI),18ZH1100,,,"Stickers convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint can result in miscommunication.",FormatComplete,,Yoonjeong,,Cha,,yoonjeong.cha@kaist.ac.kr,KAIST,Daejeon,,"Korea, Republic of",,,,,,Jongwon,,Kim,,jong1k@kaist.ac.kr,KAIST,Daejeon,,"Korea, Republic of",,,,,,Sangkeun,,Park,,sk.park@kaist.ac.kr,KAIST,Daejeon,,"Korea, Republic of",,,,,Dr.,Mun,Yong,Yi,,munyi@kaist.ac.kr,KAIST,Daejeon,Daejeon,"Korea, Republic of",,,,,,Uichin,,Lee,,uclee@kaist.edu,KAIST,Daejeon,,"Korea, Republic of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yoonjeong Cha: KAIST; Jongwon Kim: KAIST; Sangkeun Park: KAIST; Mun Yong Yi: KAIST; Uichin Lee: KAIST,jong1k@kaist.ac.kr; sk.park@kaist.ac.kr; munyi@kaist.ac.kr; uclee@kaist.edu,1679

How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68\% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs.

We combine a user-centred approach to understanding lived experiences of families (interviews, design workshops) with an expert-led understanding of what makes interventions psychologically effective. Our findings suggest the potential of technology to enable a shift in how prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through a new model of `child-led, situated interventions', where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent `skills application'.

Rather, technology development takes place up to, and including, its successful establishment in an associated body of practices. This places emphasis upon the role of practitioners as designers of their own practice environments. While the activities of professional technology development have been reasonably well discussed and conceptualized, activities that practitioners perform to make things work for them are less acknowledged as a systematic contribution to the successful establishment of the use of IT. This paper considers in particular the so-called ‘point of infrastructuring’: the moment at which practitioners become aware of opportunities to (re-)design their infrastructures, usually initiated by breakdowns or the recognition of potential innovations and reconsideration of current infrastructural use. From this point onwards, end users themselves may start configuring, tailoring or developing new conventions until a point has been reached in which a new technology usage has been successfully established. However, points of infrastructuring do not only provoke end-user driven in-situ design (or ‘infrastructuring’) activities. They also evoke so-called ‘resonance activities’. These encompass all of the observations and communications that attend upon a point of infrastructure as it becomes visible within a work environment. Examination of resonance activities can be a starting point for a better understanding of the practitioner’s activities beyond single infrastructural changes, providing a way of highlighting the relationship between different points of infrastructuring. How to capture and understand resonance activities and how to design technological support for them is still an open question. Based on previous work outlined in the literature and an empirical study that looked at collaborative appropriation activities (the most important aspect of infrastructuring) during 3D printing processes, we outline the concept of sociable technologies as a technological approach for capturing and supporting resonance activities and thus enabling infrastructuring activities more broadly.",,Infrastructuring; Appropriation; Resonance Activities; Sociable Technologies; CSCW,H.5.3,,,,,,,,FormatComplete,Prof. Dr.,Thomas,,Ludwig,,thomas.ludwig@uni-siegen.de,University of Siegen,Siegen,,Germany,,,,,Prof. Dr.,Volkmar,,Pipek,,volkmar.pipek@uni-siegen.de,University of Siegen,Siegen,,Germany,,,,,Dr,Peter,David,Tolmie,,peter.tolmie@gmail.com,Universitat Siegen,Siegen,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thomas Ludwig: University of Siegen; Volkmar Pipek: University of Siegen; Peter David Tolmie: Universitat Siegen,volkmar.pipek@uni-siegen.de; peter.tolmie@gmail.com,1753

As almost every notable professional team has its own online fan community, these communities provide great opportunities for investigating this research question. In this work, we provide the first large-scale characterization of online fan communities of professional sports teams. Since user behavior in these online fan communities is inherently connected to game events and team performance, we construct a unique dataset that combines 1.5M posts and 43M comments in NBA-related communities on Reddit with statistics that document team performance in the NBA. We analyze the impact of team performance on fan behavior both at the game level and the season level. First, we study how team performance in a game relates to user activity during that game. We find that surprise plays an important role: the fans of the top teams are more active when their teams lose and so are the fans of the bottom teams in an unexpected win. Second, we study fan behavior over consecutive seasons and show that strong team performance is associated with fans of low loyalty, likely due to ""bandwagon fans."" Fans of the bottom teams tend to discuss their team's future such as young talents in the roster, which may help them stay optimistic during adversity.

We apply our framework to study public discussions on Facebook at two complementary scales. First, we use it to predict the eventual trajectory of individual discussions, anticipating future antisocial actions (such as participants blocking each other) and forecasting a discussion's growth. Second, we systematically analyze the variation of discussions across thousands of Facebook sub-communities, revealing subtle differences (and unexpected similarities) in how people interact when discussing online content.

Organizations that employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations across organizational boundaries.

This approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic ‘way of seeing’ coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. The coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. In this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. We join manual collection of Instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how Instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. We argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. We discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online.

In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups.

However, a number of significant challenges are preventing online boycotts from reaching their potential. In particular, complex webs of brands and subsidiaries can make it difficult for participants to conform to the goals of a boycott. Similarly, participants and organizers have limited visibility into a boycott’s progress. This affects their ability to use sociotechnical innovations from social computing to incentivize participation. To address these challenges, this paper makes a system contribution: a new boycott tool called Out of Site. Out of Site uses lightweight automation to remove obstacles to successful online boycotts. We describe the design challenges associated with Out of Site and report results from two phases of deployment with the GrabYourWallet and Stop Animal Testing boycott communities. Our findings highlight the potential of boycott-assisting technologies and inform the design of this new class of technologies. Finally, like is the case for many systems in social computing, while we designed Out of Site for pro-social uses, there are a number of easily predictable ways in which the system can be leveraged for anti-social purposes (e.g. exacerbating filter bubble issues, empowering boycotts of businesses owned by racial, ethnic, and religious minorities). As such, we developed for this project a new, very straightforward design approach that treats preventing these anti-social uses as a top-tier design concern. This approach stands in contrast to the status quo of ignoring potential anti-social uses and/or considering them to be a secondary design priority.

Our goal is to incorporate the benefits of having action plans in the complex domain of writing, while mitigating the time and effort costs of creating plans. To mitigate these costs, we introduce a vocabulary—a finite set of functions pertaining to writing tasks—as a cognitive scaffold that enables people with necessary context (e.g. collaborators) to generate action plans for others. We develop this vocabulary by analyzing 264 comments, and compare plans created using it with those created without any aid, in an online study with 768 comments (N=145) and a lab study with 96 comments (N=8).

We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders’ tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders’ needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals.

The model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. Classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. Findings show that: (1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; (2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and (3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. These findings help in revisiting early RTCE design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in RTCE protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing).",,Collaborative Editing; Real-Time; User Behavior; Conflict Resolution; Simultaneous Editing; Etherpad,H.5.3,,,,,,,,FormatComplete,,Gabriele,,D'Angelo,,g.dangelo@unibo.it,University of Bologna,Bologna,,Italy,,,,,,Angelo,,Di Iorio,,angelo.diiorio@unibo.it,University of Bologna,Bologna,,Italy,,,,,,Stefano,,Zacchiroli,,zack@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr,Universitè Paris Diderot,Paris,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gabriele D'Angelo: University of Bologna; Angelo Di Iorio: University of Bologna; Stefano Zacchiroli: Universitè Paris Diderot,g.dangelo@unibo.it; zack@pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr,1926

Our work explores the value of approaching this problem from a different perspective---one of actionability---with the idea that information relevance may vary across responder role, domain, and other factors. This approach asks how we can get the right information to the right person at the right time. We interviewed and surveyed diverse responders to understand what ``actionable'' information is, allowing that actionability might differ from one responder to another. Through the findings, we (1) offer a nuanced understanding of actionability such that it complements existing approaches based on situational awareness; (2) describe responders' perspective of what distinguishes good information when making rapid judgments; and (3) suggest opportunities for augmenting social media use to highlight information that needs immediate attention.

Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to limit their propagation. It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities. What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work  answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions. We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial \textit{agents}, the \textit{actions} they perform, and their \textit{targets}. By computationally detecting agent--action--target triplets in conspiratorial statements, and grouping them into semantically coherent clusters, we develop a notion of \textit{narrative-motif} to detect recurring patterns of triplets. For example, a \textit{narrative-motif} such as \textit{``governmental agency--controls--communications''} {appears in diverse conspiratorial statements alleging that governmental agencies control information to nefarious ends. } Thus, \textit{narrative-motifs} expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances. In the process, these representations help us understand \textit{how} users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret \textit{what} they talk about. Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.

We explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. We qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. We found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. We discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person’s engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. We also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools.

To better understand how complex work is accomplished under these conditions, we conducted in-situ observations in the center’s control room and interviewed communication specialists. We found that communication specialists self-organized by using a mix of material and immaterial coordination mechanisms, including work schedules, computer systems, and tacit agreements to coordinate tasks.

Through a survey of 710 Twitter users who recently posted an emoji-bearing tweet, we found that at least 25% of respondents were unaware that the emoji they posted could appear differently to their followers. Additionally, after being shown how one of their tweets rendered across platforms, 20% of respondents reported that they would have edited or not sent the tweet.

To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the ``filter bubble'' hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. ``answer boxes''), and other factors.

In this paper, we use mixed-methods to examine distributed critique practices in a UX-focused online creative community on Reddit. We found that distributed critique resembles studio critique categorically, but differs qualitatively. While studio critique often focuses on depth, distributed critique often revolved around collective sensemaking, through which creative workers engaged in iteratively interpreting, defining, and refining the artifact and their process.

This can result in low quality feedback in project-based design courses. We report on an experiment in which students (N=59) worked on twelve-week design projects and both wrote and received online feedback at four stages. The experiment tested a novel assignment strategy of peer mentorship, where peers were assigned to give feedback to all stages of the same project, and tested showing the context from the preceding design stage when composing feedback. The results showed that displaying the context from the preceding design stage led to feedback with higher perceived quality at the late design stages (but not at earlier stages) and feedback from mentors prompts longer responses from the feedback recipients. Our work contributes deeper empirical understanding of how assignment strategies and showing additional context affects peer feedback and provides practical guidelines for instructors to implement these methods in design courses.

Our results indicate that relationships' interactions on a new SNS have negative effect on the parties' communication frequency on the focal SNS. The communication frequency of older relationships on the focal SNS is more susceptible to the influence of the interacting on the new SNS, while relationships with more common groups and more extensive posts are less likely to be influenced. Our findings imply opportunities for SNS designers to strengthen their existing fragile ties and help users to build much more robust relationships.",,Social network sites; Social relationships; User interaction; Weibo; Douban,,,,,,,,,,,Peng,,Zhang,,,Fudan University,,,,,,,,,Haiyi,,Zhu,,,University of Minnesota,,,,,,,,,Tun,,Lu,,,Fudan University,,,,,,,,,Hansu,,Gu,,,Seagate Technology,,,,,,,,,Wenjian,,Huang,,,Fudan University,,,,,,,,,Ning,,Gu,,,Fudan University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Peng Zhang: Fudan University; Haiyi Zhu: University of Minnesota; Tun Lu: Fudan University; Hansu Gu: Seagate Technology; Wenjian Huang: Fudan University; Ning Gu: Fudan University,,

Romantic couples are the most frequently messaged contacts on mobile and communicate about a wide range of topics with each other, need to make joint decisions, and may have several roles in relation to each other (e.g., spouse, co-parent). Through a 3-week field study with ten U.S. diverse couples we studied how couples use a messaging app that allows them to compartmentalize their conversations into multiple “channels” around topics of their choice. We detail how couples managed and used channels in daily life, and channels’ strengths and limitations. We found that channels made couples feel more organized, and helped with finding content and keeping track of topics. However, it was sometimes difficult to choose or navigate channels. We discuss perceived impacts of channels on relationships (e.g., topic-switching during conflicts), and outline design opportunities for messaging apps. ",,Messaging apps; instant messaging; couples; romantic partners; channel; Slack.,,,,,,,,,,,Nazanin,,Andalibi,,,Yahoo,,,,,,,,,Frank,,Bentley,,,Yahoo,,,,,,,,,Katie,,Quehl,,,Yahoo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nazanin Andalibi: Yahoo; Frank Bentley: Yahoo; Katie Quehl: Yahoo,,

However, many systems do not emphasize or support explicit linking between people (e.g., Wikipedia or Reddit), and even fewer explicitly link communities. Instead, network analysis is performed through inference on implicit connections, such as co-authorship or text similarity. Depending on how inference is done and what data drove it, different networks may emerge. While correlated structures often indicate stability, in this work we demonstrate that differences, or misalignment, between inferred networks also capture interesting behavioral patterns. For example, high-text but low-author similarity often reveals communities ""at war'' with each other over an issue or high-author but low-text similarity can suggest community fragmentation. Because we are able to model edge direction, we also find that asymmetry in degree (in-versus-out) co-occurs with marginalized identities (subreddits related to women, people of color, LGBTQ, etc.). In this work, we provide algorithms that can identify misaligned links, network structures and communities. We then apply these techniques to Reddit to demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to decipher inter-group dynamics in social media.",,Inter-group similarity; Reddit; social network analysis; misaligned links,,,,,,,,,,,Srayan,,Datta,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Chanda,,Phelan,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Eytan,,Adar,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Srayan Datta: University of Michigan; Chanda Phelan: University of Michigan; Eytan Adar: University of Michigan,,

Many disabled respondents also described proactively disclosing as a technique to filter potential connections. Our findings suggest that individuals with disabilities must perform additional labor and navigate complex group norms in pursuit of personal connection.

Our goal is to understand if and how the multimodal affordances of SNS mediate participation and new literacies for dyslexic youth, and how these affordances interact with identity work. Seven young people struggling with literacy were interviewed about their use of SNS. Our results show that the visual affordances of SNS enable new forms of participation and expression, furthering our understanding of visual literacies.

This may be a result of contributors' level of motivation, as it is deeply intertwined with activity. Existing studies on participation focus on activity dynamics but overlook the accompanied changes in motivation. To fill this gap, this study examines the interplay between contributors’ fun motives and activity over time. We combine motivational data from two surveys of Wikipedia newcomers with data of two periods of editing activity. We find that persistence in editing is related to fun, while the amount of editing is not: individuals who persist in editing are characterized by higher fun motives early on (when compared to dropouts), though their motives are not related to the number of edits made. Moreover, we found that newcomers’ experience of fun was reinforced by their amount of activity over time: editors who were initially motivated by fun entered a virtuous cycle, whereas those who initially had low fun motives entered a vicious cycle. Our findings shed new light on the importance of early experiences and reveal that the relationship between motivation and participation levels is more complex than previously understood.",,Peer production; online communities; Wikipedia; motivations; fun; sustained participation,,,,,,,,,,,Martina,,Balestra,,,New York University,,,,,,,,,Lior,,Zalmanson,,,New York University,,,,,,,,,Coye,,Cheshire,,,UC Berkeley,,,,,,,,,Ofer,,Arazy,,,University of Haifa,,,,,,,,,Oded,,Nov,,,New York University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Martina Balestra: New York University; Lior Zalmanson: New York University; Coye Cheshire: UC Berkeley; Ofer Arazy: University of Haifa; Oded Nov: New York University,,

When crowdsourcing reached a saturation point, the motivation factors weakened and the crowd disengaged. Learning was the only factor that did not weaken. The participants learned while interacting with others, and the more actively the participants commented, the more likely they stayed engaged. Crowdsourced policymaking should thus be designed to support both epistemic and interactive aspects. While the crowd's motives were rooted in self-interest, their knowledge perspective showed common-good orientation, implying that rather than being dichotomous, motivation factors move on a continuum.

However, complex goals such as design and engineering have remained stubbornly difficult to achieve with crowdsourcing workflows. Is this due to a lack of imagination, or a more fundamental limit? This paper explores this question through in-depth case studies of 22 workers across six workflow-based crowd teams, each pursuing a complex and interdependent web development goal. We used an inductive mixed method approach to analyze behavior trace data, chat logs, survey responses and work artifacts to understand how workers enacted and adapted the crowdsourcing workflows. Our results indicate that workflows served as useful coordination artifacts, but in many cases critically inhibited crowd workers from pursuing real-time adaptations to their work plans. However, the CSCW and organizational behavior literature argues that all sufficiently complex goals require open-ended adaptation. If complex work requires adaptation but traditional static crowdsourcing workflows can't support it, our results suggest that complex work may remain a fundamental limitation of workflow-based crowdsourcing infrastructures.",,Crowdsourcing; workflows; human computation,,,,,,,,,,,Daniela,,Retelny,,,Stanford University,,,,,,,,,Michael,,Bernstein,,,Stanford University,,,,,,,,,Melissa,,Valentine,,,Stanford University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Daniela Retelny: Stanford University; Michael Bernstein: Stanford University; Melissa Valentine: Stanford University,,

Results indicate the two most common obfuscations, blurring and pixelating, are ineffective. On the other hand, inpainting, which removes an object or person entirely, and avatar, which replaces content with a graphical representation are effective. From a viewer experience perspective, blurring, pixelating, inpainting, and avatar are preferable.

In this paper, we try to investigate privacy leakages in EBSNs, by examining a popular EBSN service Meetup. More specifically, we tried to answer what private information can be mined from the site’s publicly available data.

Prior research has shown that crowdsourcing can pose privacy risks (e.g., de-anonymization) to crowd workers. However, little is known about the specific privacy issues crowd workers have experienced and how they perceive the state of privacy in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present results from an online survey of 435 MTurk crowd workers from the US, India, and other countries and areas. Our respondents reported different types of privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation, profiling, scams), experiences of privacy losses (e.g., phishing, malware, stalking, targeted ads), and privacy expectations on MTurk (e.g., screening tasks). Respondents from multiple countries and areas reported experiences with the same privacy issues, suggesting that these problems may be endemic to the whole MTurk platform.

By applying an integrative mixed-methods approach drawing on trace ethnography, we place these alleged cases of bot-bot conflict into context and arrive at a better understanding of these interactions. We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia.

By interviewing 30 participants from both academia and industry, the paper examines how people write together using today’s commercially available systems. The analysis focuses on the new co-editing capabilities (e.g., track changes) that are integrated into commercial tools and thus adopted by users widely in the last decade. These capabilities enable new ways of working together (e.g., directly edit the content at the character level at the same time), but users reported reluctance to fully commit to these new working styles. We thus systematically analyze users’ rationales of why they do not want to write together while they are writing together with other.

Given prior research, this was a striking result. To explore further, we used a Bayesian approach to verify absence of ratings bias (as opposed to merely not detecting bias).

When other computing research areas have experienced similarly rapid growth (e.g. human computation, eco-feedback technology), early stage literature reviews have proved useful and influential by identifying trends and gaps in the literature of interest and by providing key directions for short- and long-term future work. In this paper, we seek to provide the same benefits with respect to computing research on the sharing economy. Specifically, following the suggested approach of prior computing literature reviews, we conducted a systematic review of sharing economy articles published in the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library to investigate the state of sharing economy research in computing. We performed this review with two simultaneous foci: a broad focus toward the computing literature more generally and a narrow focus specifically on HCI literature. We collected a total of 112 sharing economy articles published between 2008 and 2017 and through our analysis of these papers, we make two core contributions: (1) an understanding of the computing community's contributions to our knowledge about the sharing economy, and specifically the role of the HCI community in these contributions (i.e. what has been done) and (2) a discussion of under-explored and unexplored aspects of the sharing economy that can serve as a partial research agenda moving forward (i.e. what is next to do).

Empirical studies regarding these issues are limited, partly due to the unavailability of relevant data. Here we aim to understand service providers of the sharing economy, investigating who joins and who benefits, using the Airbnb market in the United States as a case study. We link more than 211 thousand Airbnb listings owned by 188 thousand hosts with demographic, socio-economic status (SES), housing, and tourism characteristics. We show that income and education are consistently the two most influential factors that are linked to the joining of Airbnb, regardless of the form of participation or year. Areas with lower median household income, or higher fraction of residents who have Bachelor's and higher degrees, tend to have more hosts. However, when considering the performance of listings, as measured by number of newly received reviews, we find that income has a positive effect for entire-home listings; listings located in areas with higher median household income tend to have more new reviews.

Based on the results, we propose three granularity-related features to incorporate into behavioral visualizations for communication in clinical settings: separating modalities, coordinating dyadic interactions, and displaying micro-behaviors.

Designing systems to support collaborative and individual use of PGD is a topic of importance in CSCW, considering the limitations of informatics tools. To inform better system design, we conducted a study including focus groups, observations and interviews with patients and providers to understand how PGD is interpreted and used. We found that while PGD is useful for identifying and solving disease-related problems, the following differences in patient-provider perceptions challenge its effective use - different perceptions about what is a problem, selecting what kinds of problems to focus on, and using different data representations. Drawing on these insights, we reflect on two specific conceptualizations of disease management behavior (sensemaking and problem-solving) as they relate to data specific activities of patients and providers and provide design suggestions for tools to support collaborative and individual use of PGD.",,Patient-generated data; personal informatics; chronic disease management; patient-provider collaboration; diabetes; interpreting data; reflection; problem-solving,,,,,,,,,,,Shriti,,Raj,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Mark,W.,Newman,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Joyce,M.,Lee,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Mark,S.,Ackerman,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shriti Raj:University of Michigan; Mark W.

The Impact of Security and Privacy on Cooperative Newsroom Work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Journalistic work is increasingly conducted using cooperative technologies. But while journalists need security and privacy just like professionals in sectors like health and education, constrained finances and missing legal requirements cause journalists to rely mostly on third-party platforms for their professional communications. In this study, we analyze how journalists manage professional collaborations across myriad tasks and contexts, with a focus on how their security and privacy concerns may shape these behaviors. We find that journalists' relatively open information-sharing practices may reflect the strength of their informal intra-organizational networks, rather than their organizational commitment per se. Moreover, while journalists—like many workers—manage their security and privacy concerns by avoiding sensitive communications via certain channels, the physical shrinking newsrooms of is reducing opportunities for the face-to-face communications journalists rely on for secure, private, professional exchange.

However, the absence of traditional journalistic gatekeeping allows information to flow unencumbered through these platforms, often raising questions of veracity and credibility of the reported information. Here we ask: How do the dynamics of collective attention directed toward an event reported on social media vary with its perceived credibility? By examining the first large-scale, systematically tracked credibility database of public Twitter messages (47M messages corresponding to 1,138 real-world events over a period of three months), we established a relationship between the temporal dynamics of events reported on social media and their associated level of credibility judgments. Representing collective attention by the aggregate temporal signatures of an event's reportage, we found that the amount of continued attention focused on an event provides information about its associated levels of perceived credibility. Events exhibiting sustained, intermittent bursts of attention were found to be associated with lower levels of perceived credibility. In other words, as more people showed interest during moments of transient collective attention, the associated uncertainty surrounding these events also increased.",,Credibility; social media; Twitter; collective attention; temporal; news events; misinformation,,,,,,,,,,,Tanushree,,Mitra,,,Virginia Tech,,,,,,,,,Graham,P.,Wright,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,Eric,,Gilbert,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tanushree Mitra: Virginia Tech; Graham P.

Crisis informatics researchers have examined conspiracy theories as a type of rumor. However, little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media. We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a public health crisis—the Zika virus outbreak. Using a mixed-methods approach including content analysis and discourse analysis, we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis, the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerge, and the particular discursive strategies through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums. Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information.

We studied this naturally occurring experiment to investigate the impact of conversation threading on user retention as mediated by several potential changes in conversation structure and style. Our analysis shows that the design change made new users significantly more likely to comment a second time, and that this increased stickiness is due in part to a higher fraction of comments receiving responses after the design change. In mediation analysis, other anticipated mechanisms such as reciprocal exchanges and comment civility did not help to explain users' decision to return to the commenting system; indeed, civility did not increase after the design change and reciprocity declined. These analyses show that even simple design choices can have a significant impact on news forums' stickiness. Further, they suggest that this influence is more powerfully shaped by affordances---the new system made responding easier---than by changes in users' attention to social norms of reciprocity or civility.

In this paper, we sought to understand how civic data hackathons could generate impactful data analytics for NPOs’ data-driven work, and how to support collaborative data analytics during hackathons. We collected various types of data (observations, surveys, and interviews) from two civic data hackathons with 9 NPOs and over 300 data volunteers in a Midwestern city in the U.S. Our results describe the collaboration activities and the types of actionable collaborative analytics outputs generated from these activities. We also identify a unique social group (i.e., client teams), who help with preparing and coordinating the event, perform brokering activities to support the collaborative analytics through the civic data hackathons. This broker role is vital for the success of the collaboration between domain experts and data experts.

This problem is even worse in the case of what we call communities of a place: people who study, live or work at the same place. Such people often share common interests but either do not know each other or fail to actively engage in submitting and relaying information. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using the aggregated clicks of entire communities of users to passively emulate a content curation service a la Reddit. To this end, we prototype and deploy WeBrowse, a content curation service based on the processing of raw HTTP logs. Evaluation based on our deployments demonstrates feasibility at scale while respecting user privacy. The majority of WeBrowse's users welcome the quality of content it promotes.

While previous research has examined bilingual social media users’ language choices, little research has focused on how people make sense of foreign language posts. In the present study, we interviewed 23 undergraduate social media users about how they consume and make sense of posts in other languages. Interviewees reported that they often did not pay attention to or engage with foreign language posts, due to a lack of relevance and contextual knowledge. When they did actively engage with foreign language posts, interviewees did not rely solely on machine translation output but instead actively collected and combined various cues from within and outside the post in order to understand what it was about. Interviewees further reported different types of goals for trying to make sense of foreign language posts; some focused on simply extracting and understanding the emotional components of a post while others tried to gain a fuller understanding of a post, including its contextual and cultural meanings.

However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased their hate speech usage-by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown ""migrants,"" those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words, other subreddits did not inherit the problem. We conclude by reflecting on the apparent success of the ban, discussing implications for online moderation, Reddit and internet communities more broadly.",,online communities; hate speech; moderation; banning; causal inference.,,,,,,,,,,,Eshwar,,Chandrasekharan,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,Umashanthi,,Pavalanathan,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,Anirudh,,Srinivasan,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,Adam,,Glynn,,,Emory University,,,,,,,,,Jacob,,Eisenstein,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,Eric,,Gilbert,,,Georgia Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eshwar Chandrasekharan: Georgia Institute of Technology; Umashanthi Pavalanathan: Georgia Institute of Technology; Anirudh Srinivasan: Georgia Institute of Technology; Adam Glynn: Emory University; Jacob Eisenstein: Georgia Institute of Technology; Eric Gilbert: Georgia Institute of Technology,,

Techniques like natural language processing and machine learning are promising approaches for identifying abusive language, but they fail to address structural power imbalances perpetuated by automated labeling and classification. Similarly, platform policies and reporting tools are designed for a seemingly homogenous user base and do not account for individual experiences and systems of social oppression. This paper describes the design and evaluation of HeartMob, a platform built by and for people who are disproportionately affected by the most severe forms of online harassment. We conducted interviews with 18 HeartMob users, both targets and supporters, about their harassment experiences and their use of the site. We examine systems of classification enacted by technical systems, platform policies, and users to demonstrate how 1) labeling serves to validate (or invalidate) harassment experiences; 2) labeling motivates bystanders to provide support; and 3) labeling content as harassment is critical for surfacing community norms around appropriate user behavior. We discuss these results through the lens of Bowker and Star’s classification theories and describe implications for labeling and classifying online abuse. Finally, informed by intersectional feminist theory, we argue that fully addressing online harassment requires the ongoing integration of vulnerable users’ needs into the design and moderation of online platforms.

However, relatively little research has focused on how to form and support teams within online learning platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A number of challenges arise for team formation in voluntary online classes: students may drop out and leave their team, and even if they do persist with the course, the team may not work together effectively.In this paper, we introduce a team-formation strategy that incorporates a deliberation process, where participants hold discussions in preparation for the collaboration task. First, we present a crowdsourced experiment that compares teams that are formed before or after a community deliberation process. Results demonstrate that teams engaging in a larger community deliberative process prior to team formation exhibit better team performance--as measured by team collaboration product quality--than pre-discussion teams. In a second crowdsourced experiment, we further explore the benefits of community-wide processes by automatically assigning teams based on participants' transactive interaction during deliberation. The results demonstrate advantages in terms of team performance for teams formed based on observed interactions during the community-level deliberation, compared to randomly formed teams. Finally, in a case study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted the team formation strategy for use in a small MOOC.

This research examines the effectiveness of systematic and heuristic cues in persuasive requests in Kiva lending teams intended to convince members to donate. An analysis of 88,596 requests exchanged in 1,610 teams shows that certain heuristic processing cues (e.g.,liking between requesters and potential lenders, advocates low authority in their teams and the importance of the team to the lender) strongly predicted whether lenders would contribute to a  loan  request.

We measured employees’ engagement based on their word choice in organizational social media, and we applied a longitudinal statistical technique which controls for homophily, employees’ traits and prior expressions of engagement. We found that engagement and disengagement spread from one employee to another with direct peers exerting the strongest influence. While engagement-spread was more powerful laterally among people at the same organizational level, disengagement-spread followed the vertical managerial chain. Further, we found that disengaged co-workers exerted a stronger influence on employee’s future engagement compared to the engaged co-workers.

To explore this issue, we interviewed 29 undergraduates about how they managed boundaries between different areas of their life. Interviewees reported maintaining flexible and permeable boundaries that are not bounded physically or temporally. They used both technological and non-technological strategies to manage different life spheres. Interviewees saw technology as a major source of boundary violations but also as a boundary managing strategy that allowed them to achieve better life balance.

In this paper, we address these questions by focusing on disclosures of schizophrenia diagnoses made on Twitter. We adopt a clinically grounded quantitative approach to first identify temporal phases around disclosure during which symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be significant. Then, to quantify behaviors before and after disclosures, we define linguistic measures drawing from literature on psycholinguistics and the socio-cognitive model of schizophrenia. Along with significant linguistic differences before and after disclosures, we find indications of therapeutic outcomes following disclosures, including improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions.

Yet, little is known about expectations of, the experience with, and the impact of self-monitoring in the workplace. To address this gap, we studied software developers, as one community of knowledge workers. We used an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach (N=20) and a survey (N=413) to infer design elements for workplace self-monitoring, which we then implemented as a technology probe called WorkAnalytics. We field-tested these design elements during a three-week study with software development professionals (N=43). Based on the results of the field study, we present design recommendations for self-monitoring in the workplace, such as using experience sampling to increase the awareness about work and to create richer insights, the need for a large variety of different metrics to retrospect about work, and that actionable insights, enriched with benchmarking data from co-workers, are likely needed to foster productive behavior change and improve collaboration at work.

To understand this tension, this study investigates community-level sharing of code on Kaggle, a contest platform for predictive modeling. Analyzing data on 25 contests in 2015 and 2016, we find that 10% of users shared code during contests, that participants doing medium well in the contest were the most likely to share code, and that sharing code improved individual, but not collective performance.

We evaluated this feature with six participants in a seven-day diary study. We found that participants used the descriptions to recall and organize their photos, but they hesitated to upload photos without a sighted person’s input. In addition to basic information about photo content, participants wanted to know more details about salient objects and people, and whether the photos reflected their personal aesthetic.

In these meetings, participants from different backgrounds collaboratively design artifacts, such as knowledge or process maps. Such meetings are orchestrated and carried out by facilitators and the success of the meetings almost solely depends on the experience of the facilitators. Previous research has mainly focused on approaches that support facilitators and participants in the upfront planning of such events. There is however, little guidance for facilitators and participants once a meeting has started. One critical aspect – among others – is that during a meeting, the facilitator and participants need to decide for how long the iterative process of discussion and design should continue. We argue that we can provide support for such decisions based on the evolution of artifacts collaboratively created during such meetings. This paper presents a multi-level, multi-method analysis of artifacts based on experts’ observations in combination with network analytics. We study the use of automated analytics to assess the evolution of collaboratively created artifacts and to indicate maturity and established consensus of the collaborative practice.

Through interviews with 14 Venmo users and surveys of 164 peer-to-peer payment app users and 80 Venmo users, we find uses consistent with other SASs and uncover novel uses that reflect the unusual inclusion of an SAS within a utilitarian app for personal finance. For many users, the SAS is a flexible feature that creates an experience that blends their task-driven use with social benefits. People write purely functional transaction descriptions with strangers, while in transactions with friends, they sometimes craft playful descriptions that enhance their experience or perform their social relationships. The SAS provides opportunities for learning about how to use the application and for keeping up with friends.

Individual so-cial capital is often connected with one’s happiness levels, well-being, and propensity to cooperate with others. The dominant approach for quantifying individual social capital remains self-reported surveys and generator-methods, which are costly, attention-consuming, and fraught with biases. Given the important role played by mobile phones in mediating human social lives, this study explores the use of phone metadata (call and SMS logs) to automatically infer an individual’s social capital. Based on Williams’ Social Capital survey as ground truth and ten-week phone data collection for 55 participants, we report that (1) multiple phone-based social features are intrinsically associated with social capital; and (2) analytics algorithms utilizing phone data can achieve high accuracy at automatically inferring an individual’s bridging, bonding, and overall social capital scores.

Yet when fans of departed celebrities express their grief in public comment threads, conversations often result in disagreements about how to grieve. These disagreements consistently appear in response to the deaths of public figures, and have been broadly labeled “grief policing.” We performed a thematic analysis of public Facebook comments responding to the deaths of Alan Rickman, David Bowie, and Prince. Our findings describe prominent grief policing practices and explain how commenters may be importing norms from other contexts when shared spaces consist of transient interactions that make norm formation difficult.

Much research has documented effects that could inform better designs, however there is a lack of practical methods to review particular concerns. We design a lightweight method for systematic reviews of community engagement scenarios, based on a catalogue of 59 techniques, presented in the form of method cards, and co-developed with community engagement experts. We validate it in problem-solving workshops with organisers, and find that a full review is feasible in under 15 minutes, that it provides effective prompts and important guidance, and can successfully support process innovation. Finally, we validate it for use in summative evaluations of online communities. In a large-scale observational study of 1 million Flickr users, application of the method reveals the surprising impact of a major site redesign: it successfully increased content engagement, but at the expense of social interactions.",,Community engagement; Online communities; Evaluation.,,,,,,,,,,,Martin,,Dittus,,,Nokia Bell Labs,,,,,,,,,Luca,Maria,Aiello,,,Nokia Bell Labs,,,,,,,,,Daniele,,Quercia,,,Nokia Bell Labs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Martin Dittus: Nokia Bell Labs; Luca Maria Aiello: Nokia Bell Labs; Daniele Quercia: Nokia Bell Labs,,

In describing this tension between conditions of normative and deviant participation, I highlight the importance of supporting opportunities for deviant and emergent participation to occur, emphasizing that design which uniquely supports narrow modes of participation can prevent opportunities for more inclusionary practice and evolving objectives.",,Peer production; Crowdsourcing; Participation; Design; Inclusion; Agency.,,,,,,,,,,,Gabriel,,Mugar,,,Engagement Lab at Emerson College,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gabriel Mugar: Engagement Lab at Emerson College,"gabriel_muga@emerson.edu

Yet, research on how Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) tools can mitigate such conflict is minimal. We conducted an experiment with 30 Japanese-Canadian dyads who completed a negotiation task over email. Dyads were assigned to one of three conditions: C1) no feedback; C2) automated language feedback of participant emails based on national culture dimensions; and C3) automated language feedback (as in C2), and participants’ shared self-reflections of that feedback. Results show Japanese and Canadian partners interpreted the negotiation task differently, resulting in perceptions of intercultural conflict and negative impressions of their partner. Compared to C1, automated language feedback (C2) and shared self-reflections (C3) made cultural differences more salient, motivating participants to empathize with their partner. Shared self-reflections (C3) served as a meta-channel to communication, providing insight into each partner’s intentions and cultural values.

However, creating and comprehending complex references can be challenging, especially when there are multiple referents to refer, or when a referent is highly specific (e.g., specific sentences in a paper rather than the paper as a whole). To identify users’ challenges in making references with multiple and specific referents while using existing discussion tools, we conducted an observational study and a preliminary interview. Based on the design lessons, we built Korero, a discussion interface that aims to facilitate complex referencing actions. For evaluation, we compared Korero against conventional interfaces in two user studies with referencing tasks of different referential difficulty. We found that Korero not only significantly reduces the time and effort in making references with multiple and specific referents, but also shows potential in increasing users’ engagement with the discussion and referent materials.",,Asynchronous discussion interface; referencing,,,,,,,,,,,Soon,Hau,Chua,,,National University of Singapore,,,,,,,,,Toni-Jan,Keith,Palma Monserrat,,, University of the Philippines Los Baños,,,,,,,,,Dongwook,,Yoon,,,Cornell University,,,,,,,,,Juho,,Kim,,,KAIST,,,,,,,,,Shengdong,,Zhao,,,National University of Singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Soon Hau Chua: National University of Singapore; Toni-Jan Keith Palma Monserrat: University of the Philippines Los Baños; Dongwook Yoon: Cornell University; Juho Kim: KAIST; Shengdong Zhao: National University of Singapore,,

Our aims are to understand how care has been conceptualized in the extant CSCW community, identify core issues and concerns, and formalize how CSCW concepts could be used as a lens to inquire into this domain. This workshop will be devoted to understanding how notions of “care” shape the methods, contexts, and practices of CSCW researchers. By shifting focus from care (a term that often connotes particular contexts for research) to care-ing (practices that involve care), we will trace patterns across multiple genres of research: from those that we typically associate with care-work (e.g., healthcare, eldercare, childcare) to those in which care motivates research objectives (e.g., social justice, sustainability) and perspectives (e.g. postanthrocentrism, feminism). This shift brings with it an expanded notion of how we might understand and design with care by framing care as a term that congeals certain sets of practices and orientations to the subjects of research. The aim of this workshop is to bring multiple practitioners to question how CSCW researchers practice and can practice “caring” within multiple realms of research. For instance, how might insights from studies of caregiving in healthcare settings apply to research involving care for the environment? How can care shape how our research is practiced and presented? How might care force us to confront and motivate action in areas for which we have long been concerned? How can we broaden our understanding of care labor and caring beyond medicalized and formalized understandings of care? As interpersonal and community interactions are increasingly facilitated through the technologies we design, how can we ensure that these often-tacit interactions are still able to take place? How might we be able to improve their efficacy?",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,Austin,,Toombs,,,Purdue University,,,,,,,,,Laura,,Devendorf,,,University of Colorado Boulder,,,,,,,,,Patrick,C.,Shih,,,Indiana University Bloomington,,,,,,,,,Liz ,,Kaziunas,,,AI Now Institute,,,,,,,,,David,,Nemer,,,University of Kentucky,,,,,,,,,Helena ,,Mentis,,,"University of Maryland, Baltimore County",,,,,,,,,Laura,,Forlano,,,Illinois Institute of Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Austin Toombs: Purdue University;Laura Devendorf: University of Colorado Boulder;Patrick C.

These tools often called backchannels or audience interaction systems, have provided the audience with a mediated channel to support their participation. Previous work has shown that these technologies redistribute agency and power in events and allow for new forms of communication to emerge. However, the focus in the research of these tools has often been only in mediated communication only or researchers have exhibited a separation of physical and digital interaction. This workshops invites researchers to revisit this distinction. Instead of analyzing mediated communication separate from the event, we call for analysis of hybrid events, highlighting changes in the communication channels, user roles and event design brought by the technology. Beyond a scientific motive to improve conceptual tools to study this phenomena, this workshop addresses changes in the technology landscape that has made audience participation easier. Compared with the previous research, today the pervasiveness of smart devices have made it simple and easy to integrate audience participation tools into events, and therefore, allow audience participation. As a result, several commercial services now exist allowing event organizers to rapidly and easily take these kinds of tools into use. This development demands a change in the research focus: instead of showing that this can be done, the research can now study emerging uses of these technologies not aided by the researchers. This means that the research should be moving from research prototypes to research product. To support academics in this transition, we believe that future research on this area must reflect aspects such as the emerging social practices or it should focus on improving socio-technical designs of existing systems. To direct the research towards these areas, this workshop seeks to develop a research agenda with conceptual frameworks and research strategies which together will direct academic studies further.",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,Matti,,Nelimarkka,,,Aalto University,,,,,,,,,Antti,,Salovaara,,,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,,Giulio,,Jacucci,,,University of Helsinki,,,,,,,,,Steven,,Dow,,,UC San Diego,,,,,,,,,Joel,,Fischer,,,University of Nottingham,,,,,,,,,Louise,,Barkhuus,,,T University of Copenhagen,,,,,,,,,Kenton,,O’Hara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Matti Nelimarkka: Aalto University;Antti Salovaara: University of Helsinki;Giulio Jacucci: University of Helsinki;Steven Dow: UC San Diego;Joel Fischer: University of Nottingham;Louise Barkhuus: IT University of Copenhagen;Kenton O’Hara: Microsoft Research;,,

Such social games enable different interaction modes, in which players engage with combinations of co-located physical environments, remote virtual environments, and players, both co-located and remote, to complete game objectives. These sophisticated collaborative systems are not easy to build; rather, they require considerable effort including designing virtual game elements, selecting suitable technologies, defining indoor/outdoor boundaries of play, and ensuring player safety. Recent advances in technology open a range of opportunities for designing new and innovative collaborative mixed reality games, and valuable insights can be gained from researchers, developers, and players on the challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned through research and design of such games. We assert that a cohesive research agenda is needed to further develop this field, which is currently lacking within the respectively interested research communities. This workshop serves as a bridge between members of the CSCW, HCI, and games community to encourage further studies and collaboration in understanding and designing the next generation of collaborative mixed reality games.",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,Sultan,A.,Alharthi,,,New Mexico State University,,,,,,,,,Katta,,Spiel,,,TU Wien,,,,,,,,,William,A.,Hamilton,,,New Mexico State University,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth,Beth,Bonsignore,,,"University of Maryland, College Park",,,,,,,,,Zachary,O.,Toups,,,New Mexico State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sultan A.

These personal informatics (PI) and quantified self (QS) technologies are designed to help users capture, reflect on, and get actionable information about personal data. In the past (and still in many cases), the design of such systems emphasized an individual-centric vantage point that focused on supporting an individual’s self-tracking, self-knowledge, and self-management activities. Over time, however, a growing number of PI researchers are recognizing that such practices are socially motivated, collaboratively conducted, and embedded in interpersonal contexts, in ways that extend well beyond single-user use cases and requirements. This is resulting in the appearance of a host of new theories, methods, and frameworks for understanding social contexts and practices within PI literature and design spaces.",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth,,Murnane,,,Stanford University,,,,,,,,,Jaime,,Snyder,,,University of Washington,,,,,,,,,Stephen,,Voida,,,University of Colorado Boulder,,,,,,,,,Matthew,J.,Bietz,,,UC Irvine,,,,,,,,,Mark,,Matthews,,,Health Rhythms,,,,,,,,,Sean,,Munson,,,University of Washington,,,,,,,,,Laura,,Pina,,,Google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth Murnane: Stanford University;Jaime Snyder: University of Washington;Stephen Voida: University of Colorado Boulder;Matthew J.

These margins include populations from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds that are typically viewed as “marginalized,” often in more ways than one.

Because they don’t require the motor skills needed for text input through a keyboard, the barriers of entry and use for older adults and people with disabilities are lowered. Yet, accessibility of speech interaction can still be a challenge. Using and designing voice interfaces is radically different from graphical interfaces, redefining how we must think about accessibility and what it means for a conversation to be accessible.",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,Robin,,Brewer,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Leah,,Findlater,,,University of Washington,,,,,,,,,Jofish,,Kaye,,,Mozilla,,,,,,,,,Walter,,Lasecki,,,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,Cosmin,,Munteanu,,,University of Toronto,,,,,,,,,Astrid,,Weber,,,Google,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Robin Brewer: University of Michigan;Leah Findlater: University of Washington;Jofish Kaye: Mozilla;Walter Lasecki: University of Michigan;Cosmin Munteanu: University of Toronto;Astrid Weber: Google;,,

The main focus is on the case of online poker, which offers an opportunity to explore the nexus of social interaction and digital media. How do data-tracking, algorithmic strategy recommendations based on rapidfire computation of odds, and automated response features reconfigure the social experience of poker? How do players themselves reflect on the possibilities and limitations of a digital interface for the game? The talk will conclude with reflections on the broader trend toward the digitization of traditional forms of gambling—not only online but within bricks-and-mortar settings (as in the turn from green-felt card games to screen-based “e-tables”). What are the economic and social stakes of this trend, both within the United States and in gambling markets abroad?",,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NA,,
